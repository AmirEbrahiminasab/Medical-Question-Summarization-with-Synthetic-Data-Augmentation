# Medical-Question-Summarization-with-Synthetic-Data-Augmentation
This project addresses the challenge of improving healthcare question summarization using synthetic data augmentation. By leveraging **Round-Trip Translation (RTT)** and advanced selection techniques (**FQD**, **PRQD**, and **QSV**), we generate diverse question paraphrases to enhance summarization model performance in low-resource settings.

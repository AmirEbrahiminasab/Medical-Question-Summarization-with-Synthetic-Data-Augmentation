## Project Overview
This project addresses the challenge of improving healthcare question summarization using synthetic data augmentation. By leveraging **Round-Trip Translation (RTT)** and advanced selection techniques (**FQD**, **PRQD**, and **QSV**), we generate diverse question paraphrases to enhance summarization model performance in low-resource settings.

### Key Objectives:
1. **Dataset Augmentation**: Use RTT to create synthetic variations of medical questions.
2. **Question Selection**: Filter augmented questions using:
   - Frech√©t Question Distance (FQD)
   - Precision-Recall Question Distance (PRQD)
   - Question Semantic Volume (QSV)
3. **Summarization**: Train and evaluate models like BART/T5 on the augmented dataset.
4. **Evaluation**: Compare results using ROUGE/BLEU metrics.

## Dataset
- **MEQSUM Dataset**: Used for medical question summarization tasks.
- Contains pairs of:  
  - Original questions (symptoms, treatments, diagnosis, medications)
  - Expert-annotated summaries

---

## Methodology
### 1. Round-Trip Translation (RTT)
Translate questions to 5 languages (Spanish, German, Italian, Chinese, French) and back to English to generate paraphrased questions.

### 2. Question Selection
- **FQD**: Measures semantic distribution similarity between original and augmented questions.
- **PRQD**: Balances precision and recall of semantic overlap.
- **QSV**: Selects questions with maximum semantic diversity using PCA and convex hulls.

### 3. Summarization Models
Tested with pretrained models like:
- **BART**
- **T5**
- **ProphetNet**
